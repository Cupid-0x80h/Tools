# Tools
Just some of the tools I created, <br>

# To run them on your system (assuming that you are using linux)
Step 1: Download the scripts(Using git clone or other methods)<br>
Step 2: Change the permission to that files make it executable (chmod 777 script.sh)<br>
Step 3: Run them (./script.sh)<br>
Note : Replace the script.sh with the name of the script file<br>
